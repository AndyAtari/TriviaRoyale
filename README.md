# Trivia Royale

A fun JavaScript trivia game! Choose a category, answer the questions as quickly as possible to gain the most points, and add your score to the High Score Board!


## Motivation 

This was a portfolio project created for Flatiron School. I wanted to learn basic game design with JavaScript. 

## Installation

After cloning the repository, 

Download PostgreSQL for [Mac](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html) or [Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

install bundler: ```$ bundle```  

Run ```$rails db:create```, then ```$ rails db:migrate```, and then ```$rails db:seed``` (if commented out, uncomment before seeding). 


## Usage

In your terminal run ```$ rails s``` and start your local server.

Open index.html in Live Server. 

Enjoy the game with your preferred web browser. 


## Roadmap

For future releases, I would like to add more questions and categories. If there is a future desire to scale up, I will considering developing the game in a more robust video game scripting language.
